# Scientific Articles Classifier

## Overview

**Description**

This is the solution given to a project proposed by a teacher of a master’s degree course.

The project consists of applying knowledge of "Topic Modeling" and making a Binary Classifier that is able to distinguish between texts that deal with the topic of "COVID-19" and texts that do not deal with that topic. For this purpose, a previously provided "dataset" of textual documents will be used.

This "dataset" consists of 26078 entries with the following columns:

1. pubmed_id: Article identifier in the PubMed database.
2. title: Title of the article.
3. abstract: Summary of the article. 
4. journal: Magazine in which it has been published.
5. year: Year of publication. 
6. is_cord19: binary tag (0 or 1) identifying whether the article is related to COVID-19.
